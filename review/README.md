# review

The PAPR economic review is broken into two sections:

1. Oracle manipulation analysis in [oracle-manipulation.md](./oracle-manipulation.md)
2. Funding rate analysis in [funding-rates.md](./funding-rates.md)

The first section deals with cost of attack calculations for manipulating the underlying Uniswap V3 pool to
intentionally trigger liquidation auctions on PAPR.

The second section focuses on the current funding rate mechanisms implemented by the protocol. It dives deeper into
ways to mitigate issues related to competing with the ETH staking rate, similar to issues experienced by RAI.

Background information summarizing our understanding of the core protocol is in [background.md](./background.md).
